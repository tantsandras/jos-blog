# Hello! 

Jo's blog was built for Jo, because we found out that you had to pay to be able to upload a customised template to your wordpress blog. I made it for her during Christmas, so I spent a week trying to put it all together. Unfortunately, I did'nt have time to finish it, but I would like to. 

## Live at : https://jos-blog.herokuapp.com/

## To run the blog:
- clone repository 
- cd into repository 
- type npm run dev in terminal 
- go to localhost:1991


## Tech stack used:
- JavaScript
- Express 
- Handlebars
- Node.js 
- PostgreSQL
- bcrypt
- JWT 

## Stretch Goals 
- Add list of existing blogposts when Jo is logged in so that she can delete a blogpost if she wants 
- Make like button
- Make comment functionality

## Thanks for reading!
